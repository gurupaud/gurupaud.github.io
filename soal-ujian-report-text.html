Galileo developed a superior telescope and mademany significant discoveries in astronomy. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the inquisition for hissupport for the Copernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system.Galileo was born in Florence, Italy in 1564 to a poor but noble family His parents recognized their child'sinnate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have him educated. At his father's insistence, Galileostudied the profitable career of medicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle's teaching which had dominated education for thepast 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University of Pisa, but his strident criticisms ofAristotle left him isolated among his contemporaries. After three years of persecution, he resigned and wentthe University of Padua, where he taught maths. His entertaining lectures attracted a large following and heable to spend the next 18 years pursuing his interests in astronomy and mechanics.1. What type of the text above?A. Narrative.B.

When a child is intentionally and repeatedly mean to another child, the cycle begins. Bullying occurs on the playgrounds, at lunch in cafeteria, in locker rooms, even over the phone. And now that so many children haw access to the latest technology, the problem has become even more prevalent.
Enter the newest room-cyber bullying-whereby children and teens deliberately use digital media to disseminate false, embarrassing, or just plain mean messages or pictures about one person to others. Cyber bullying can occur via text email, Facebook, Twitter, or other social media outlets. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying “the most common online risk for all teen.”
Studies have shown that between 25 percent to 45 percent of teens report being bullied online. Many kids report such treatment having occurred more than once. Cyberbullying is affectingallages, as even young children often have access to technology and the internet.
Children of all ages need to understand that the internet is not a „safe place, and that it is a pubic forum. Even if you delete a message or photo, it actually continues to exist in cyberspace. Also, many teens mistakenly think they will not „get caught” if they bully someone online, or that such behavior is „not that big a deal”.
All parents need to discuss internet safety and the problem of cyberbullying with their children. This is especially important for tweens and teens, as they spend much of their time online Just as kids must learn and practice good manners in public, they also need to mind their manners online if a child would not say something to another young person‟s face, then the same dig should not be emailed or texted. It is really as simple as that.
This is what I call the “front door rule”: Tell your child that if he‟she writes an email or text, or posts something derogatory about another person on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram (or other sites), to think before they push “send”. If they would not want to post the information on their front door for family members and all neighbors to see, they should stop, think and change-or forget about-the message. It could hurt someone more than they realize and could also be forwarded on to hundreds, thousands, even millions of others.   Which of following best describes theorganization of this text?

And now that so many children haw access to the latest technology, the problem has become even more prevalent.
Enter the newest room-cyber bullying-whereby children and teens deliberately use digital media to disseminate false, embarrassing, or just plain mean messages or pictures about one person to others. Cyber bullying can occur via text email, Facebook, Twitter, or other social media outlets. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying “the most common online risk for all teen.”
Studies have shown that between 25 percent to 45 percent of teens report being bullied online. Many kids report such treatment having occurred more than once. Cyberbullying is affectingallages, as even young children often have access to technology and the internet.
Children of all ages need to understand that the internet is not a „safe place, and that it is a pubic forum. Even if you delete a message or photo, it actually continues to exist in cyberspace. Also, many teens mistakenly think they will not „get caught” if they bully someone online, or that such behavior is „not that big a deal”.
All parents need to discuss internet safety and the problem of cyberbullying with their children. This is especially important for tweens and teens, as they spend much of their time online Just as kids must learn and practice good manners in public, they also need to mind their manners online if a child would not say something to another young person‟s face, then the same dig should not be emailed or texted.

If they would not want to post the information on their front door for family members and all neighbors to see, they should stop, think and change-or forget about-the message.

                            21. SOAL UJIAN MASUK UM UGM 2014*     While bullying has always been a problem encountered during childhood and adolescence, we all know it is on the rise. When a child is intentionally and repeatedly mean to another child, the cycle begins. Bullying occurs on the playgrounds, at lunch in cafeteria, in locker rooms, even over the phone. And now that so many children haw access to the latest technology, the problem has become even more prevalent.
Enter the newest room-cyber bullying-whereby children and teens deliberately use digital media to disseminate false, embarrassing, or just plain mean messages or pictures about one person to others. Cyber bullying can occur via text email, Facebook, Twitter, or other social media outlets. The American Academy of Pediatrics calls cyber bullying “the most common online risk for all teen.”
Studies have shown that between 25 percent to 45 percent of teens report being bullied online. Many kids report such treatment having occurred more than once. Cyberbullying is affectingallages, as even young children often have access to technology and the internet.
Children of all ages need to understand that the internet is not a „safe place, and that it is a pubic forum. Even if you delete a message or photo, it actually continues to exist in cyberspace. Also, many teens mistakenly think they will not „get caught” if they bully someone online, or that such behavior is „not that big a deal”.
All parents need to discuss internet safety and the problem of cyberbullying with their children. This is especially important for tweens and teens, as they spend much of their time online Just as kids must learn and practice good manners in public, they also need to mind their manners online if a child would not say something to another young person‟s face, then the same dig should not be emailed or texted. It is really as simple as that.
This is what I call the “front door rule”: Tell your child that if he‟she writes an email or text, or posts something derogatory about another person on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram (or other sites), to think before they push “send”. If they would not want to post the information on their front door for family members and all neighbors to see, they should stop, think and change-or forget about-the message. It could hurt someone more than they realize and could also be forwarded on to hundreds, thousands, even millions of others.   The word “derogatory” in line 23 could best replaced by ....
A. disappointing B. annoying
C. inconvenient D. embarrassing E. offensive</h2><br />
                        Berdasarkan konteks kalimat dapat kita simpulkan bahwa makna derogatory adalah menyinggung. Maka yang paling sesuai adalah "offensive".<br /><br /><strong>Jawaban: E</strong><br />
